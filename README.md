Network Intrusion Detection
This project analyzes a dataset that simulates network intrusion detection, designed to identify and classify intrusions in a network environment. The dataset is derived from a simulated US Air Force LAN, where multiple types of network attacks were generated to test detection methods.

About the Dataset
Background
The dataset simulates a military network environment under various cyber-attacks, focusing on a typical local area network (LAN) of the US Air Force. The environment captured TCP/IP network traffic data, where each connection between source and target IPs was recorded as either "normal" or an "attack." This realistic setting involved varied attack methods to test network security measures.

Dataset Details
Connections: Each entry represents a TCP/IP connection, detailing communication between a source and target IP over a specific time interval.
Features: The dataset consists of 41 features, which are categorized as follows:
Quantitative Features: 38 numerical attributes that describe different characteristics of network connections.
Qualitative Features: 3 categorical attributes that provide additional context for each connection.
Target Label: The target variable labels each connection as either:
normal: Indicates normal network traffic.
attack: Specifies a particular type of network intrusion or cyber-attack.
Data Format
Each record in the dataset contains approximately 100 bytes of information, with 41 features and a single label for each connection. This label allows models to learn and differentiate between normal and malicious activity in the network.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a model that can:

Identify and classify network intrusions based on the connection data.
Enhance cybersecurity measures by predicting attacks in real-time network traffic.
Project Workflow
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Initial exploration of data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.
Feature Selection: Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and other techniques to identify important features.
Model Training: Training several machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, etc.) and optimizing their hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance on metrics like accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
Testing and Validation: Testing models on unseen data and using cross-validation for robust performance measurement.
Models Used
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost
Results
Model performances are evaluated based on the training and test scores. The models are compared based on classification metrics to identify the best model for network intrusion detection.

Requirements
Python libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, lightgbm, xgboost, and optuna for hyperparameter tuning.
Optional: Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration and visualization.
Usage
